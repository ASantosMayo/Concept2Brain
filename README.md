Data used for training the model, pictures and model parameters dicts (i.e. trained model) are not allocated here because of Github size restriction, yet can be accessed from the OSF repository: https://osf.io/7dpgm

The Concept2Brain model is deployed in https://concept2brain.brainbodybehavior.science/ where any user can access a friendly-use web-based tool to generate EEG brain signals from any picture or written text.
